# About Fibonacci Symbol Classification

A system to assign symbols to Fibonacci numbers based on their modulo 3 value.

## Rules

Divide the Fibonacci number by 3 and check the remainder:
- Remainder 0 → ⭕
- Remainder 1 → 🔲
- Remainder 2 → ❎

## Example
```
F(0) = 0 ≡ 0 (mod 3) → ⭕
F(1) = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → 🔲
F(2) = 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3) → 🔲
F(3) = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 3) → ❎
F(4) = 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) → ⭕
```
